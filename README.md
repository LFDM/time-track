### Usage

- Clone this repository
- Run setup once:  `node index.js setup`
- Start a work session with `node index.js start`
- Stop a work session with `node index.js stop`
- Output your stats with `node index.js show`

It's probably best to aliases to your terminal configuration to do this
more efficiently.

At a later point this will be available as npm package, which will come
with an executable.
